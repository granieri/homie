# Homie
Homie is a game we developed for [Global Game Jam 2019](https://globalgamejam.org/). The theme was "what does home mean to you?" so we decided to think about what home *will* mean in the futureâ€”a smart home! In Homie, you play as a smart home speaker, and try to make your human happy. At the end of the day (which lasts about 45 seconds), you get an inside look at what your human thought of his new tech. 

You can play it at http://anterrobang.org/homie (shout out to ant for hosting)
